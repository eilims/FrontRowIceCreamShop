Informative text detailing specific pythonic representations used for important components of the simulator + MDP problem solver

[SUBJECT TO CHANGE], current MDP solver is written with the assumption of these data structures

States "S"
===========================
    A list of states of size |S|

Actions "A"
===========================
    A list of actions of size |A|

Transition Probabilities "P"
===========================
    Dictionary with an action from A as keys and transition matrices of |S|*|S| size for values
    - For a given action key, the appropriate transition matrices' entries (indexed i,j for row, col) each denote the probability
      of transitioning from state i to state j under that action.
    - |A| entries/keys in total

Rewards "R"
===========================
    Similar to "P":

    Dictionary with an action from A as keys and reward matrices of |S|*|S| size for values
    - For a given action key, the appropriate reward matrices' entries (indexed i,j for row, col) each denote the immediate or expected reward
      of transitioning from state i to state j under that action.
    - |A| entries/keys in total
